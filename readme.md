# Boiler

This is an opinionated boilerplate for creative web development. Use it at your own risk. I have the project open sourced so that others can learn or make improvements, plus to share what i am working on.

## Main Features

- Vite
- Bun
- Three
- Custom Virtual DOM
- JSX
- Virtual Scrolling
- GSAP (although will move away when i build my own animation system)
- SASS

The idea is simple. I want to template with JSX, which allows me to pump it right into Javascript classes. Vite allows me to use esbuild and use my own JSX Factory, creating a custom Virtual DOM that handles routing and such. I want to use little-to-no third-party packages. This is a design choice, but also a choice that allows me to work through building it all from scratch. Having little dependencies also allows me to build the whole boilerplate in a cohesive manner, removing fluff and redundancy.

This boilerplate is meant to be picked apart. This is by no means a complete, done-for-you boilerplate. It is simply a start and I encourage developers to add or remove components/classes to make a tailored code-base for each project.

If you don't like it thats fine.

Enjoy.
